    <h3>What is css?</h3>
    <div class="ol">
        <p>1. css stands for cascading style sheets</p>
        <p>2. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,webpage and other. </p>
        <p>3. <span class="st">Css is not necessary</span><span class="hl"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of webpages all at once.</p>
        <p>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></p>
    </div><br>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <div class="uol"><ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However <span class="hl">in this<br>tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demostrate and easier<br> for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul></div>
    <p class="para">when comparing CSS class vs id the difference is that class applies a style to multiple elements. id, on the other hand applies a style to one unique element id is also<br>special in that you can use a special url to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>
    <p class="para">In CSS selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on aweb page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the<br>element.</p>
    <p class="para">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
